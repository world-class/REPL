# Numerical Mathematics - Reported problems
This page is about the [numerical mathematics module](../../../modules/level_4/numerical_mathematics/).

## Week 1
### Video: 1.001 Introduction to number bases and modular arithmetic
- At 11:16, `(255, 255, 255)` is **white**, not blue.

### Video: 1.101 Introduction to number bases
- At 11:34: Wrong. Each column is a power of 60, so it should be times `1`, times `60` and times `3600`.


### Video: 1.107 Place value for fractional numbers: binary
- At 0:37: The "fractional point" is called "radix point".

### Practice quiz: 1.110 Rational and irrational numbers: decimal and binary
- Answers should be given without spaces.
- When a repeating fractional part is present, the answer should be written as `i.rr...`, where `i` stands for **integer part**, `r` is the **repeating** fraction and one must include three dots at the end. Example:

  $$3.12121212121212$$

  is written as

  $$3.1212...$$


## Week 2
### Video: 1.401 Octal and hexadecimal (integer)
- In the quiz at 3:41, the place values are supposed to be entered as "1, 16, 256". The answer isn't accepted.
- In the quiz at 4:24, 65536 should be written as $2^{16}$, but the "6" isn't part of the exponent part.
- At 5:07, second letter in hexadecimal should be "B", not "D".
- At 6:01, the hexadecimal number `11F` should have an expansion starting with $1 \times 16^2$, not $1 \times 16_2$ as displayed.
- In the quiz at 6:29, the third answer is 256, not 64. The last part is asking in the quiz for multiples in binary while the answer is given for hexadecimal.

### Practice quiz: 1.404 Translate between decimal and hexadecimal or octal (fractional)
- `3.44` in octal is $3 + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{16}$, not $3 + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{32}$.
- Options may present groupings of numbers. If a grouping is supposed to be of **3** digits for instance and you're presented with **4** digits, assume that the last digit should be in subscript (representing the number base, such as **2** for binary or **8** for octal) so that it makes sense when reading. In a grouping of 3 digits, `0002` should be interpreted as `000`, base `2`.

### FIXED - Video: 1.405 Special relationship between binary and hexadecimal, and binary and octal
- At 7:38, this is wrong. `C` (base 16) = 12 (base 10) = 1100 (base 2), not 1101.
- At 11:24, The grouping of digits is wrong. $1.001.111 1$ in binary should read $1 001.111 100$, having only one radix point.
- At 11:37, it is said the answer is `11.71` (base 8). Wrong: It's `11.74` (base 8).

### Practice quiz: 1.406 Translate between binary and hexadecimal/octal
- Question 6: `73.06` (base 8) *is* `111011.00011` in binary.

### Practice quiz: 1.602 Arithmetic in hexadecimal/octal
- `6D × 60` in hexadecimal is `28E0`.
- `6C × 3B` in hexadecimal is `18E4`.

## Week 3
### Lesson 1.10
#### Video: 1.1004 Multiplicative identity, inverse mod k, exponentiation mod k
- At 27:20, 8<sup>3</sup> is _not_ 255 but 512.

#### Video 1.1006 Mod, rem and division
- At 1:49, the expression isn't rendered properly (the congruence symbol doesn't appear). Subsequent expressions also present this issue.

### Lesson 1.11
#### Video 1.1101 Encryption using modular arithmetic
- The video contains many display errors that are fixed in a previously uploaded version. While not being flawless, it's much better. For now, the video can be downloaded [from this link](https://www.dropbox.com/s/w52vpsau7ly6tc6/1_1101_Encryption_using_modular_arithmetic.mp4?dl=1). If you want to add subtitles, you can [download them here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/5hso65rut3u337q/1_1101_subtitles-en.vtt?dl=1).
  - If you don't know how to add the subtitles to the video, try with [VLC media player](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/) (free): open the video (`1_1101_Encryption_using_modular_arithmetic.mp4`) and from VLC, click at the top on `Subtitle`, then on `Add Subtitle File...` and open the subtitles file (`1_1101_subtitles-en.vtt`). They will automatically be added and synced to the video.
- At 3:43, a banner appears in the background and has nothing to do with was it being taught.
- At 4:40 and 4:52, the congruence symbol is not rendered properly: $C \equiv M^e \pmod p$.

- At 6:04, it should be $C^7 \pmod {11}$, **not** $C^3 \pmod {11}$.
- At 8:43, the equation appears in the background and can't be read. The equation is: $ed = 3 \times 7 = 21$.

- At 11:28, again the expression can't be read. The expression is: $a^p \equiv a \pmod p$.


## Week 4
### Lesson 2.1: Video 2.103 Defining sequences
- Audio is out of sync from 15:19 onward: please refer to the transcript to better follow along.

### Lesson 2.2: Video 2.201 Arithmetic progressions
**Partially fixed**. The transcript and subtitles do not appear at this moment.

## Week 5
### Lesson 2.5
#### Video 2.502 Series: sums of terms of sequences; summation symbol: sigma notation
- At 20:38, the number `32` was skipped when calculating the sum of the series.

#### Video 2.509 Finite sums
- At 10:11, the summation for the term $k^2$ is omitted.

### Lesson 2.6
#### Practice quiz: 2.602 Limits of sequences
- Question 1: There is no clear way to indicate that there is no limit or what the considered interval really is.

#### Video 2.604 Patterns in series; limit; convergent and divergent series
- The result for the last example is $\frac{1}{3}$, not $270$.

#### FIXED - Practice quiz 2.608 Criteria for identifying convergent/divergent sequences and series
- Question 1: The answer is `divergent`.
- Question 2: The answer is `convergent,3/4`.

### Summative quiz
- Question 2: The quiz does not accept the valid answer and tells the user that the wrong answer is correct instead.

## Week 6
### Lesson 3.1
#### Video 3.101 Cartesian coordinates
- There is no sound. For now, you can download the video [from this link](https://www.dropbox.com/s/922gj1vefoedx0y/3_101_cartesian_coordinates.mp4?dl=1). You can get the subtitles [from this link](https://www.dropbox.com/s/arvg0fuu7867vnl/3_101_subtitles-en.vtt?dl=1).
  - If you don't know how to add the subtitles to the video, try with [VLC media player](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/) (free): open the video (`3_101_cartesian_coordinates.mp4`) and from VLC, click at the top on `Subtitle`, then on `Add Subtitle File...` and open the subtitles file (`3_101_subtitles-en.vtt`). They will automatically be added and synced to the video.

### Lesson 3.2
#### Video 3.204 Functions and tables of values
- At 10:44, $f(\frac{-3}{4}) = \frac{-2}{\frac{-3}{4}} = \frac{8}{3}$, not $\frac{2}{3}$.

#### Video 3.207 Plotting graphs by hand – straight lines
- At 4:17, the result of $\frac{-1}{2}x + 3 = 0$ is $x = 6$, **not** $x = -6$.

#### Video 3.211 Plotting graphs by hand – reciprocal
- There is no sound nor visual guidance from 8:16 till 8:35.

### Lesson 3.4
#### Video 3.401 Kinematic equations
- At 8:00, the last formula presented at the bottom of the slide should not have $a^2$ but $a$ instead, as follow: $$s(t) = vt - \frac{1}{2}at^2$$

### Summative quiz
- No formatting seems appropriate to answer question 2. None of the following is accepted: `inf`, `infinity`, `infty`.

## Week 7
### Lesson 4.1
#### Video 4.101 Introduction to angles and triangles
- At 17:09, $\frac{37 \times 2\pi}{360} \approx 0.646 rad$, **not** $0.323 rad$.

### Lesson 4.2
#### Practice quiz 4.204 Trigonometric ratios in the right-angled triangle
- Questions 6 and 7 present different errors:
  - The information in the question doesn't necessarily match the data in the picture.
  - The grader expects impossible answers for the missing side and/or angle. Verify your answer with Pythagoras's theorem and the sine rule instead of relying on the grader.

#### Video 4.206 Trigonometric ratios in the right-angled triangle: Part 2
- At 14:03, $tan(B) = \frac{b}{c}$, **not** $tan(B) = \frac{b}{a}$.

## Week 8
### Summative quiz
- Question 1: The given angles in the selection are computed correctly, but they do not correspond to the correct letter: the value of angle **C** should be the value of angle **A** and vice versa.
- Question 4: The grader appears to consistently invert the solution when converting from radians to degrees. For example, **40 radians** is **~131.83°** but the expected answer is **0.698°**, which is the result **in radians** of **40°**.
- [**fixed**] The quiz doesn't let the student see what the mistakes are once the quiz has been submitted.

## Week 10
### Lesson 5.3
#### Practice quiz 5.307 Solving trigonometric equations
- Question 3: The answer should be _None of the other options is correct_ when asked for a value of $x$ where $tan(180^\text{o} - x) = tan(45^\text{o})$.

### Lesson 5.4
#### Summative quiz 5.402 Trigonometric functions
- Question 2: The option $cos(355^\text{o}) = cos(360^\text{o} - 355^\text{o}) = 0.996$ is valid and should be selected, but is currently marked as wrong.
- Question 3: Some translations that should occur in the negative x-direction, such as $sin(3x + 1)$, are mistakenly graded as being in the positive x-direction.

## Week 12
### Lesson 6.2
#### Video 6.207 Logarithmic equations
- At 14:40, a negative sign is added to $e^2$. The equation should instead be: $$e^2 x + e^2 = x \iff e^2 x - x + e^2 = 0$$

## Week 13
### Lesson 7.2
#### Practice quiz 7.202 Differentiation from first principles
- Question 1: The selection is invalid. $5x^{5-4}-3 \cdot2x^{2-1}+0$ should not be selected as it is not equivalent to the right answer, which is also another available option to select: $$\frac{d}{dx}(x^5-3x^2-1) = 5x^4-6x = x(5x^3-6) \neq 5x^{5-4}-3 \cdot2x^{2-1}+0$$

### Lesson 7.3
#### Video 7.303 Chain rule
- At around 3:45, the final expression for the derivative of $$y=\frac{1}{3x^2-5x+2}$$ is missing a negative sign in front of it. The correct expression should be as follow: $$y'=-\frac{6x-5}{(3x^2-5x+2)^2}$$

## Week 14
### Lesson 7.6
#### Practice quiz 7.602 Calculus topic
- Questions 5 and 6 assume $n\to \infty$, which is indispensable to know to calculate the limit.

## Week 15
### Lesson 8.1
#### Video 8.101 Representations and properties of vectors
- At 4:16, the notation for the vector is wrong. It should instead be: $$\vec{v} =\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\ 2 \end{pmatrix}$$

### Lesson 8.2
#### Video 8.204 Operations with matrices: linear combination, multiplication
- At 9:48, the resulting matrix contains an error at row 2, column 4. The correct value is **122** as shown in this matrix:
$$ A \times C = \begin{pmatrix} 12 & 1 & -6 & 50 & 6 \\ 21 & 4 & \frac{-27}{2} & 122 & 15\\ \end{pmatrix}$$

## Week 17
### Lesson 9.1
#### Video 9.109 Designing regular shapes: polygons and stars
- The video blacks out from 2:53 onward.
