This page is about the [Web Development module](../../../modules/level_4/web_development/).

## Week 6

### Lecture: 3.3.10 HTML media tags

- Video: The video appears with all sorts of white dots all over. It looks
  like the professor is in a snowball.

### Practice Quiz: 3.3.11 Review information

- The `width` attribute is _not_ a global attribute.
- The `png` file extension _is_ from image files.
- The `jog` file extension should not be selected because it doesn't really
  exist. Unless it's a typo for `jpg` or `jpeg`.
- The `bmp` file extension _is_ from image files.

## Week 15

### Practice quiz 8.1.6, 8.2.2 and 8.2.5
