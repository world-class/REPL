# Algorithms and Data Structures I - Reported problems

This page is about the [Algorithms and Data Structures I module](../../../modules/level_4/algorithms_and_data_structures_i/).

## Week 6

### 3.3.4 Using stacks to check for palindrome words

- The widget has been designed to be compatible with Google Chrome. For instance, some highlighting functions during the initial tutorial do not work as expected on Firefox.

### 3.4.4 Using stacks to check html tags

- The same issue as in 3.3.4 is present: Google Chrome is the preferred web browser.
