# Introduction to programming I - Reported problems
This page is about the [Introduction to programming I module](../../../modules/level_4/introduction_to_programming_i/).

## Sleuth cases
### Rookie
#### 101, stage 3
- Use only `fill()` and `rect()` commands. You can adjust opacity with `fill()` by adding a fourth value like so:

    fill(R, G, B, A);

  where `R`, `G` and `B` stand for **red**, **green**, **blue** and can have values from 0 to 255 and `A` stands for **alpha** and is optional. In this case, a value of about `100` is fine so you can see through the shape being drawn.

#### 201, stage 4
- Some students were given cases where body parts of the judge are missing (i.e., legs appear outside the canvas, for instance). In those cases, you may be better off just failing all your attempts and wait for a new randomized case to be given to you as you probably won't be able to get 100%.
- If your answer isn't accepted, try increasing the number of times you have `vertex()` in your code. Answers including at least 40 to 50 vertices have been reported to work better.
- You should only use `beginShape();`, `vertex(x1, y1);` and `endShape(CLOSE);` in your code.

#### Other glitches
##### Sleuth cases with spotlight effect
Be aware that those Sleuth cases involving a spotlight effect will not work on Firefox out of the box (they work in any webkit based browser like Google Chrome and Safari). There are possible workarounds such as commenting out the line at the bottom that says `blendMode(DARKEST);` and uncommenting it again before submitting the case. Changing it to `blendMode(LIGHTEST);` should work at least to be able to see where the spotlight is.

##### Variable assignment
- Some cases ask to set the value of a variable to `mouseX` for instance and then make sure it doesn't go above or below a certain value with `min()` and `max()` functions. Answers can wrongly be accepted if you first set

      variable = mouseX

  and then reassign it by applying a function that is missing a parameter:

      variable = max(X)

  where `X` is an integer. The variable should be assign in one statement as follow instead:

      variable = max(mouseX, X)


### Pro
#### 601, stages 1-4
Where the stroke(r, g, b) command is used, it seems to be a requirement to use noFill() as well in order to get the grader to accept the submission. Similarly, it may be required to use noStoke() in conjunction with fill(r,g,b). In the instructions it is not stated to use noStroke() and noFill(). (reported by Gerry [@gstarch]) 

#### 701, stage 4
Some versions of this stage have misspelled words which prevent the student from solving the case. If you encounter the words `plasic` or `nerveous`, you need to make sure that your solution searches for `plastic` or `nervous` instead. Some other variations along those lines with other misspelled words may exist but haven't been reported yet.

#### 702, stage 4
_"My suspect's car didn't have enough space to pull out in front of me before speeding off, so the chase wouldn't work as expected. I deliberately got myself suspended so I could grab another case, and it worked fine."_ (reported by [@dannycallaghan](https://github.com/dannycallaghan))

#### 802, stage 2
##### Random function
_"They ask you to create an array of random integers between two values. The `random()` function in `p5.js` includes the lower number, but excludes the upper number. So if you do `random(5,9)`, it might well generate a **5**, but never a **9**._

_Naturally I incremented the upper value by one so it'd actually generate values between the two numbers requested, but the puzzle actually expects you to just naively slot the two values into random and not fix the bug."_ (reported by *Pehoulihan*)


### Global Sleuth glitches
#### `console.log();` statements
If you get this message when submitting a case:

    There is an error in your code ... Error in compile SyntaxError: Unexpected token )

Be sure that you have removed all of your debugging statements that are using `console.log();`. This is one of those unexpected situations where your statements should have no effect, but they do somehow.

#### Function parentheses
If you get this message when submitting a case:

    TypeError: studentFunctionCodeString.search is not a function

You need to ensure that any function being declared does not have a space between the function name and the argument. So for example:

    function myFunc() // Grader should accept this
    function myFunc () // Grader might not accept this


## Week 1
### Lesson 1.1
#### Video: 2D coordinate system
- At 3:56, the top left corner should have coordinates `(4, 3)` instead of `(5, 3)`.
- At 3:56, the width of the rectangle is `12`, not `11`.


## Week 3
### Lesson 2.2
#### Practice quiz: Using the console and debugging syntax errors
- Question 3: "triangle" is misspelled â†’ `trinagle`, adding an additional error which is not an argument error. However, the spelling mistake shouldn't be taken into account.

## Week 7
### Lesson 4.1
#### Video: Conditional statements using ==
- The bomb exercise template is missing.

### Lesson 4.2
#### Practice quiz: Introducing types: String, Number, Boolean
- Question 5: The question asks for **two** ways to reuse the variable `numWays` but expects **three** selected answers.

#### Practice quiz: Conditionals with types
- Question 3: The question says the answer _"No, because  answer is neither a number, nor is it equal to the number 42"_ is correct. However the correct answer is _"Yes, because answer is equal to 42"_.
- Question 5: The question says the answer `parseInt(a+b)*c` is correct and the others are all wrong: however `(a+b)*c` is also correct. They both produce the same result.
