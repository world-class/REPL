## Unable to generate a link for the midterm

In Coursera, you may face the message _"Error updating shared link"_ when trying to generate a link for the midterm. A possible solution is described as follows:

1. Open the lab environment in Coursera.
2. Make sure you have a backup of your files from the lab: **you _may_ lose your work in step 4**!
3. Click **Help** in the top-right corner (_not_ the "Help" menu inside VS Code, the one from Coursera).
4. Under the heading _"UPDATE LAB TO THE LATEST VERSION"_, click _"Get latest version"_.
