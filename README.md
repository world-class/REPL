A twist on the use of **REPL**, which stands for *read–eval–print
loop* in computer programming. This repository aims to become a central
place to share resources that other learners have found useful,
especially in the context of studying a [BSc Computer Science offered by Goldsmiths, University of London](https://london.ac.uk/courses/computer-science) :school:.
