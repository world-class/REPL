# Introduction

A twist on the use of **REPL**, which stands for *read–eval–print
loop* in computer programming. This repository aims to become a central
place to share resources that other learners have found useful,
especially in the context of studying computer science at the bachelor
level.


## The Learning Hub for UoL's Online CS Students

:school: As the first cohort of students enrolling in the 100% online
[BSc Computer Science offered by Goldsmiths, University of London](https://london.ac.uk/courses/computer-science),
it is in our interest to cooperate in order to maximize our chances of
celebrating all together when we graduate.

Good luck to all and may this path fulfill you, knowing that you will
find support along the way!

## Important note before we go

:exclamation: **This is not a place where you'll find prohibited content, such as
leaked confidential information and copyrighted material. Anything that
could potentially fall under the
[regulations of the University of London](https://london.ac.uk/current-students/programme-documents/regulations)
will be removed if it appears by accident and you are welcome to report
it. :+1:**


# How to ask for help?
Succeeding in this degree has a lot to do with how resourceful you are. This page is meant to be a helpful guidance along the way, but developing a few key skills on your own will become an increasing necessity, including **being able to research online**, **debugging code effectively** and **knowing how to ask questions**.

To get started on that learning path, please refer to the following web pages:
