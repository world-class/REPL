# Guide to Module Prerequisites & Progression: How to Avoid Being 'Progression-Blocked' due to Missing Prerequisites, and a Suggested Module Schedule

**Updated Jan 22nd 2021: Added special consideration for PBA students**

Hello there, /r/UniversityofLondonCS!

We've recently had posts and comments with questions regarding the progression within this degree programme, especially from new applicants. I decided to write this post as a general guide to progression within the programme, explain the prerequisites for advancement from FHEQ Level 4 to Level 5, as well as present a suggested module schedule.

## How does progression work within this degree programme?
The University of London's Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science is composed of [22 modules plus a Final Project](https://london.ac.uk/computer-science-structure) (For more information regarding the degree's structure, [see my other guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/UniversityOfLondonCS/comments/hgbcc8/beginners_guide_to_grades_projects_exams_and/)). These 22 modules are all worth 15 credits each, and are divided into three levels: There are FHEQ Level 4 modules, FHEQ Level 5 modules, and FHEQ Level 6 modules.

Each Level is more advanced than the previous Level, hence there are *progression rules* which govern when a student may register for Level 5 and Level 6 modules. As this guide is intended for applicants and new students, we will only discuss the progression requirements of Level 5 modules:

> **Requirements to progress through the BSc**
>
> **5.11**
>
> To progress to FHEQ Level 5 modules, you must have:
>
> * Passed, or been awarded credit through recognition of prior learning, for at least 45 credits at Level 4, including Introduction to Programming I and either Discrete or Computational Mathematics; and
>
> * made an attempt at a further 45 credits at Level 4, including both Introduction to Programming II and the remaining Level 4 maths module; and
>
> * registered for any Level 4 modules not yet attempted alongside your Level 5 modules, excluding any for which you have been awarded credit through recognition of prior learning

## Are all Level 4 modules offered every term?
**No. The Discrete Mathematics (DM) and Computational Mathematics (CM) modules are only available on an alternating basis.** Discrete Mathematics is only available on the October (Fall) term, while Computational Mathematics is only available on the April (Spring) term.

Other than this exception, all other level 4 modules are available every term.

## What does it mean to become 'progression-blocked?'
Because the DM and CM modules are only available on an alternating basis, if you do not register (and complete) them one after the other, you could end up in a situation where you are blocked from progressing on to Level 5 modules due to not fulfilling the progression requirements. Here's an example of a student that became 'progression-blocked':

**1st Term (Only DM is offered)**

Normal progression:

* Intro to Prog I
* **Discrete Maths**
* Web Development

**2nd Term (Only CM is offered)**

Normal progression:

* Intro to Prog II
* How Computers Work
* Algorithms and Datastructures

**3rd Term (Only DM is offered)**

**Progression Blocked!**
Cannot register for any Level 5 modules because CM is not completed. Cannot register for CM because only DM is offered this term!


* Fundamentals of CS

**4th Term (Only CM is offered)**

**Progression Blocked!**
Cannot register for any Level 5 modules because CM is not completed!

* **Computational Maths**

As you can see in the above example, the student who became 'progression-blocked' is forced to spend their 3rd and 4th term enrolling in only 1 module, instead of 3. Only by their 5th term will they be able to enroll in all Level 5 modules as normal. This obviously delays one's expected graduation date, and it is best avoided.

## How can I not become 'progression-blocked?'
**The simplest way to not run afoul of progression requirements is to take your maths (and programming) modules one after the other.** This means if you have CM offered in your first term, register for DM in your second term, and vice versa.

Essentially, the *gatekeeping* modules in Level 4 are your maths (CM/DM) and programming (Intro to Prog I, Intro to Prog II) modules, as they are the only ones specifically listed in the progression section of the programme regulations. As long as you make sure to take your maths and programming modules one right after the other, you may register for your remaining Level 4 modules in whatever order you wish, without fear of becoming 'progression-blocked'

## Are there any special considerations for PBA Students

As an important additional note: For Performance-Based Admissions students who intend to study four modules per term every term after their first term, it is important that you [apply for an Recognition of Prior Learning \(RPL\) via the Google IT Prof. Cert. in order to bypass the How Computers Work \(HCW\) module](rpl-guide.md) on your first term. **Otherwise, PBA students will risk becoming progression blocked when registering for their third term, due to not passing 45 credits yet.**

This consideration **only** applies to PBA students who intend to take 4 modules per term after their first term. If you only intend to take 3 modules per term after your first term, you will be fine.

If this sounds a little confusing right now, check out the recommended 'schedule' for PBA students taking 4 modules per term below.

## What is your recommended 'schedule' of modules to take which will avoid 'progression-blocking'?

You really don't need a schedule to not be progression-blocked, as long as you complete your maths and programming modules right after each other. However for those who are worried, the following schedules will guarantee progression from Level 4 to Level 5.

### Recommended schedule for 3 modules per term
**1st Term**

* **Intro to Prog I**
* **CM/DM (whichever is offered)**
* *[Any Level 4 module]*

**2nd Term**

* **Intro to Prog II**
* **CM/DM (whichever is offered)**
* *[Any Level 4 module]*

**3rd Term**

* *[No longer at risk of being 'progression-blocked']*

### Recommended schedule for 4 modules per term
**1st Term**

* **Intro to Prog I**
* **CM/DM (whichever is offered)**
* *[Any Level 4 module]*
* *[Any Level 4 module]*

**2nd Term**

* **Intro to Prog II**
* **CM/DM (whichever is offered)**
* *[Any Level 4 module]*
* *[Any Level 4 module]*

### 3rd Term
* *[No longer at risk of being 'progression-blocked']*

### Recommended schedule for PBA student w/ 4 modules per term after 1st term

**1st Term**

* **Intro to Prog I**
* **CM/DM (whichever is offered)**
* [**Coursera's Google IT Prof. Cert. for RPL to bypass HCW**](rpl-guide.md)

*PBA Students can only take 2 modules in their first term*

**2nd Term**

* **Intro to Prog II**
* **CM/DM (whichever is offered)**
* *[Any Level 4 module]*
* *[Any Level 4 module]*

### 3rd Term
* *[No longer at risk of being 'progression-blocked']*

## What about progression from Level 5 to Level 6? Or from Level 6 to Final Project?
There is are separate sets of progression requirements which govern further progression into the degree programme. These rules can be found in the [Programme Regulations, Sections 5.11 and 5.12 (pages 16-17)](https://london.ac.uk/sites/default/files/regulations/progregs-bsc-computer-science-2021-22.pdf).

As these are more advanced topics that are only relevant to advanced students, they are out-of-scope for this guide. Students are encouraged to consult the Programme Regulations, and direct their questions to the private students-only Slack.

## What happens if I am unable to take CM/DM right after each other, as suggested?
You may run into issues. You could potentially avoid being severely delayed [if you plan things out carefully](https://www.reddit.com/r/UniversityOfLondonCS/comments/koeeo8/how_not_to_fall_in_pba/ghup7un/)... but in general, it is *highly* inadvisable.
