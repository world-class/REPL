## :one: Just enrolled - First steps

### Getting access to the programme

#### How long do I have to wait to receive the student email and student card

- Expect a delay of approximately 4 to 6 weeks before you get access. You will receive an email to activate your ISIC virtual student card.

#### What can I do if I can't log in to my student email

- Try updating your password in the [student portal](https://my.london.ac.uk): this password will also be used to log in to your university email.

#### What is my username to log in to the student's portal at my.london.ac.uk

- Your username is the same as your student email address: that would be `USERNAME` in the address `USERNAME@student.london.ac.uk`.

#### When do I get access to the modules on Coursera

- You will receive an email a few business days (sometimes more) after your successful registration as a student once your payment has been made.
- **Your first step** should be to complete the **Orientation course** on Coursera – otherwise you won't be able to start your modules. Make sure you have selected _University of London_ for your modules on Coursera (see screenshot below) to display the course and then you can access it from [the home page](https://www.coursera.org/degrees/bachelor-of-science-computer-science-london/home) of this programme on Coursera or [directly from this link](https://www.coursera.org/learn/london-cs-orientation).
  ![coursera UoL selection](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/world-class/binary-assets/master/images/faq/coursera_uol_selection_2020-09-13.png)
- Even once you have completed the **Orientation course**, you will get access to the modules **once the start date of the semester has been published** – check the home page of the student portal at https://my.london.ac.uk for an official answer and be on the lookout in the `#general` channel of the :lock: [Slack workspace](http://londoncs.slack.com/) (students only): it will be announced as soon as it is known. Additionally, make sure you have joined the `#announcements-from-uol` channel on Slack because official communication sent by UoL via email will be shared there (this is not a channel for questions, only for communication **FROM** UoL).

### Getting access to student perks

#### GitHub Student Pack

- You can take advantage of the [GitHub student pack](https://education.github.com/pack) by registering with your student email and giving proof of enrollment (a screenshot of your latest payment for any module will do).
- This gives you access to professional tools from JetBrains (IDEs), free domain names, access to courses on platforms such as FrontendMasters, etc.

#### O'Reilly Online Learning - Library

- [Access it from this link](https://go.oreilly.com/university-of-london-worldwide) to find a plethora of books on algorithms, computer science, math, software developement and many other interesting fields!

### :question: I need help! Whom should I ask

#### Module-specific inquiries

- You can reach out to your tutors in the appropriate discussion forums on Coursera. Access any module you are enrolled in from the home page of this degree on Coursera.

#### Non-academic questions

- You can write in the **Reach out** forum on Coursera (in the **orientation module**).

#### Private matters and other types of academic inquiries

- You can write an email to Student Relationship Mangers (SRMs) BScCS-Support@london.ac.uk

#### Technical issues on Coursera

- If you think you're having technical problems with Coursera, create a ticket at: [https://learner.coursera.help/hc/en-us](https://learner.coursera.help/hc/en-us)

#### Small queries regarding a module

- You can ask in module specific Slack channel. Be sure to thank the person who helps you :smile:

### Slack community

#### When and how I can get access to the student Slack workspace

- When your first semester is about to start, you will receive an email from the university inviting you to join.
- :lock: Invitations are sent by the university to enrolled students only.

#### :exclamation: What are the basics on how to use Slack

- [Available shortcuts](https://slack.com/help/articles/201374536-Slack-keyboard-shortcuts)
- [How to format your messages](https://slack.com/help/articles/202288908-Format-your-messages)
- [How to share snippets of code](https://slack.com/slack-tips/share-code-snippets) (JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Python, C++, etc.)
- [How to use pinned items](https://slack.com/intl/en-mx/help/articles/205239997-Pin-messages) (important info in each channel)
- [How to search effectively](https://slack.com/intl/en-mx/help/articles/202528808-Search-in-Slack) (filtering by channel, user, date, file types, etc.)
- [How to find channels](https://slackhq.com/introducing-channel-search-for-slack)
- [Slack help center](https://slack.com/help) for anything else

#### How do I reply to a specific user using threads

- It's very important to use threads while communicating to keep chats organized. — [https://slack.com/intl/en-in/help/articles/115000769927-Use-threads-to-organise-discussions-](https://slack.com/intl/en-in/help/articles/115000769927-Use-threads-to-organise-discussions-)

#### I want to discuss off-topic things with other students, where should I go

- A list of Slack channels [can be found here](../slack/README.md).

### What equipment/software/hardware do I need for this degree

- The following is subject to change. Please refer to the [programme's specifications](https://london.ac.uk/courses/computer-science) for details.

#### General

- Computer: requirements are very basic and can be found on the [Computer requirements](https://london.ac.uk/applications/how-apply/computer-requirements) page from the university's website.
- Other hardware: you will need a webcam (or any other video recording device that can be connected to your computer, such as a smartphone) for some programming courses (at least for [Graphics Programming](../modules/level-5/cm-2030-graphics-programming/README.md)) and a microphone (at least for [Object-Oriented Programming](../modules/level-5/cm-2005-object-oriented-programming/README.md)). The audio recording could be done from a laptop (if it has an integrated microphone) or from a smartphone.
- Software:
  - Web browsers: Google Chrome is recommended for programming assignments (in [Introduction to Programming I](../modules/level-4/cm-1005-introduction-to-programming-i/README.md), [Introduction to Programming II](../modules/level-4/cm-1010-introduction-to-programming-ii/README.md), [Graphics Programming](../modules/level-5/cm-2030-graphics-programming/README.md), [Web Development](../modules/level-4/cm-1040-web-development/README.md) and other courses with a focus on web technologies) as this is the browser used by most lecturers. As a backup, Firefox is a great option because it uses a different engine to render pages and you may face different issues on different browsers with libraries such as [p5.js](https://p5js.org/), which is used in a few modules in the degree.
  - A word processor that accepts Microsoft Word formats (.doc and .docx).
  - A PDF reader (e.g. Adobe).

[Check out this page](../slack/README.md) for a list of useful resources you'll find on Slack as well as how to use it (e.g, pinned items, channels, replying in threads, searching for information, etc.).
- Sync your calendar with Coursera and make sure you know what's the current week number for the ongoing semester. You can find more about this [on this page](../README.md#calendar-due-dates-and-events).

### Is there a simple repository of all knowledge generated regarding this program

- Yes — [https://github.com/world-class/repl](https://github.com/world-class/repl)

### How to access the library

- See the page [https://www.coursera.org/learn/london-cs-orientation/supplement/Umu9M/student-resources](https://www.coursera.org/learn/london-cs-orientation/supplement/Umu9M/student-resources) as a logged in student.

### What is my student email address

- It's of the form `initials_with_numbers@student.london.ac.uk` (e.g. `ab123@student.london.ac.uk`). You access it [from a Google account](http://mail.google.com/a/student.london.ac.uk).

### When can we expect our ISIC cards

- The email will come from <information@myisic.com>, so make sure you add this address to your email account so that it doesn’t go to your spam folder. If you do not receive an email, or you have any issues with your ISIC card, contact <virtual@myisic.com>. You can also log an enquiry in the ‘Ask a Question’ link in your student portal, in order for us to look into this further for you if necessary.

**Note:** The ISIC card may not be offered in future semesters.

### What kind of materials will the university deliver to us

- When you register, we will give you access to your Student Portal. You can then access your
  University of London email account and two other key resources:
  - The Virtual Learning Environment (VLE). Here, you can access electronic copies of all printed study
    materials, resources including audio-visual, and forums to discuss course material and work
    collaboratively with others.
  - Access to academic support and feedback from London-based support teams. Tutors introduce the
    modules, respond to queries, monitor discussions and provide guidance on assessments. There will be
    interactive and engaging study materials including videos, quizzes and online games, so you can feel
    confident about your progress.

## Modules and progression

### How to avoid being 'progression-blocked' due to missing prerequisites, and a suggested module schedule

- See [this article in the Subreddit section of the REPL](../subreddit/grades-guide.md) for details.

### Do I have to notify the university if I want to take a break from the next semester

- No. Simply do not register for new modules to skip the next semester.

### Can I publicly share my assignments online on sites like GitHub or GitLab

- **You are strongly advised not to do so**, as is indicated in the submission guidelines of some modules. As per the guidelines in _Introduction to Programming II_ (as of June 2021): _"Do not host code on publicly available version control repositories (i.e. GitHub) **before or after** the submission"_ (emphasis added).
- As a computer science student, it is highly recommended that you use a VCS tool such as [Git](https://git-scm.com/) to keep track of your work. Therefore, you can publish your work in _private repositories_ on both [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/) with a free plan. Please note that as a student of this programme, you can take advantage of the **[GitHub student pack](https://education.github.com/pack)** by registering with your student email and giving proof of enrollment (a screenshot of your latest payment for any module will do).

### Can I still access the modules I have taken once the semester is over

- Note that certain quizzes, especially summative ones, become locked and you cannot even see the questions anymore. Other than that, lectures and other pages remain accessible.
- On the [main page of the programme on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/degrees/bachelor-of-science-computer-science-london/home/), once the grades are released, the courses will move to the `Summary` tab rather than staying in the `In Progress` tab.

### Can a student switch pathways/specialisms as the course goes on

- You may apply to transfer between BSc Computer Science specialist pathways offered under these regulations provided that

  1. you have selected, or are still able to select, the core modules on the degree to which you wish to transfer;
  2. you are still within your maximum period of registration;
  3. you have not failed at the final attempt, a module that is core on the degree to which you wish to transfer;
  4. you have not passed more than one Level 6 module which does not fit on the degree to which you wish to transfer;
  5. you are not yet eligible for the BSc award upon which you are currently registered. For further information please see the [programme regulations](https://london.ac.uk/sites/default/files/regulations/progregs-bsc-computer-science-2021-22.pdf).

### How can I drop/withdraw from module

- You will have 14 days from the beginning of your course (the day your modules become available on the platform) to withdraw a module or transfer it to a later study session. After 14 days, any fees paid to the University will not be refunded unless there are mitigating circumstances which we will consider on submission of the relevant evidence. Please see [terms and conditions](https://london.ac.uk/applicationshow-apply/terms-and-conditions) for further information.

### What is the maximum number of modules that one can select per semester and what if I fail one module

- The maximum number of modules you can register for in any one session is five (or three plus the final project). This can be a combination of new modules and resits (with a maximum of four new modules), or resits only.
- For further information please see the [programme regulations](https://london.ac.uk/sites/default/files/regulations/progregs-bsc-computer-science-2021-22.pdf).

### Where can I see a syllabus or module specification of all available modules

- When enrolled as a student: [https://www.coursera.org/learn/london-cs-orientation/supplement/YUBNS/syllabus-introduction-to-programming-1-cm1005](https://www.coursera.org/learn/london-cs-orientation/supplement/YUBNS/syllabus-introduction-to-programming-1-cm1005)
- [Module specifications](https://github.com/world-class/binary-assets/tree/master/modules/module-specification) and [syllabi](https://github.com/world-class/binary-assets/tree/master/modules/syllabi) are shared unofficially as they are made available.

### How can I progress to level 5 modules

- To progress to Level 5 modules, you must have:
  - completed at least 45 credits at Level 4, including Introduction to Programming I and either Discrete or Computational Mathematics;
  - made an attempt at a further 45 credits at Level 4, including both Introduction to Programming II and the remaining Level 4 maths module;
  - registered for any Level 4 modules not yet attempted alongside your Level 5 modules.

### Which math topics should I review before taking Computational Mathematics as to feel comfortable during the course

- I would recommend reviewing a UK A-Level Maths textbook.

### Can I at some point in the future switch to on campus and continue my degree

- Goldsmiths welcomes applications from students who wish to transfer to an on-campus degree. To complete your degree in two years of full-time study at Goldsmiths, you must have completed eight Level 4 modules successfully. To complete your degree in one year of full-time study at Goldsmiths, you must also have completed eight modules at Level 5.

- If you are interested in transferring to Goldsmiths and have successfully completed the required courses (or expect to do so in your intended year of transfer), please contact the Computing Team.

### Would on-campus be at the usual UK tuition fee rate

- We would advise contacting Goldsmiths directly about this. Please see this email address - <intcomp@gold.ac.uk>.

### Do you recommend taking four modules at a time if they are available

- Unfortunately, it is not for us to recommend, as it very much depends on your current circumstances. It is important to think about how much time you can give to your studies, as you should allow 6-10 study hours per week for a module.

### What are the officially suggested study hours for this programme

- _"You should allow, on average, the equivalent of 6-8 hours of study each week per module."_

### Does each module in Level 4 courses actually take 7 hours per week per module, I have some programming experience

- No. It really depends on what you already know and the course you take. Introduction to Programming will probably be a breeze for you, maybe web development too. You could spend half as much and still be good to go (3.5 hours / week / module). However, it really depends how well you want to understand the topics, you could also spend twice as much if you want to go in depth, although the academic level is not very high if you stick to the basic requirements.

- It's a good idea to allow more time for theoretical modules especially if you don't have experience with the content compared to the practical ones which are more about programming assignments. It's hard to tell. Many students work full-time and are fine with 3 modules per semester. Some have more experience and work full-time while doing 4 modules, but that can be too much for many who are less experienced.

### Can a BSc CS student take more than 22 modules (excluding the final project)

> I'm currently taking an Internet of Things specialism, but I may probably take an interest in Games Development in the future.

- If you want to study additional modules via a separate institution or platform, this is up to you. However, we would urge you to consider the time commitment of studying these additional modules.
- You will study over 22 weeks which means you should allow 6-10 study hours per week for a module.

### Final project

#### Can we register 3 modules plus the final project in the last semester

- You are only able to study for a maximum of 60 credits per session, so this would not be possible. You would need to study for two modules and the final project.

#### Is the final project done in a team or individually

- This will consist of an **individual** project.

---

## Coursera

### Do we still get access to the module resources once the module is complete

- Yes. You will not be able to access graded coursework items to review past submissions, but you can still access the videos in each week of the **Overview**, the **Grades** page, your **Notes** if any, extra **Resources** if any as well as the **Discussion Forums**.

### Is there a way to remove old courses from the "In Progress" tab on the home page of the programme on Coursera

- No. The "Orientation module" is always there because it contains updated information that's still relevant. As for past modules you may have completed, they will disappear once the university has taken care of all the grading necessary after a while.
- Instead of accessing the home page listing all your current modules, students recommend bookmarking the links to the module. You can also make use of _"custom search engines"_ and _"bookmark keywords"_ on all major web browsers: simply search for those features if you're interested.

### Is Coursera down, why do I see an error page (404) when I try to access my module(s)

- Your session has expired. Go to [coursera.org](https://www.coursera.org/) and log in again.

### Modules involving mathematics

#### Why am I seeing weird symbols in the questions from the quizzes

- For instance, for a question about predicate logic, you might see something like `p \(\lor \neg \)q` as part of the question. This is a mathematical expression that has not been rendered properly and/or not rendered yet. **Solution:** Refresh the page to see the proper notation appear, i.e. `p V ¬q` in this example.

## Programme regulations

This (intentionally short!) section serves as a reminder to read [the programme regulations](https://london.ac.uk/sites/default/files/regulations/progregs-bsc-computer-science-2021-22.pdf) in details :book:, which answers general questions well enough.

Some of the questions that can be answered by reading the programme regulations:

- How much do I need to pass module X? (**answer:** 40%)
- I am a PBA (Performance-Based Admission) student, what does that mean?
- I am taking module X, what type is it? Does it have a written exam?
- What are the registration and progression rules?
- What do we learn in module X? Do we ever study X?
- What happens when I defer an assessment?
- What is RPL?
- What specializations are available?

### How do I setup calendar sync on Coursera

- [https://www.coursera.org/learn/london-cs-orientation/supplement/xNQ2h/calendar-sync-and-time-zones](https://www.coursera.org/learn/london-cs-orientation/supplement/xNQ2h/calendar-sync-and-time-zones)

### I don't want to miss important announcements, what to do

- Make sure you have a filter in your email for UoL emails. Also subscribe to :lock: [#announcements-from-uol](https://app.slack.com/client/TDT1N1BUG/CM4KKHUCB) on Slack (students only).

### How long are vacations between semesters

- **About 3-4 weeks**, give or take, with the possibility of smaller breaks in between if you manage your time well (it's up to you).
- **Semester 1:** April 8 2019 to September ~13 2019 (the deadline was extended for a module so you could have been done earlier). **Break:** 25 days.
- **Semester 2:** October 7 2019 to March 9 2020. **Break:** 41 days.
- **Semester 3:** April 19 2020 to September ~23 2020 (it depends on the exams you take, but roughly ending a week earlier than that with the theory). **Break:** 19 days, till October 12 (we started a week later due to the pandemic). Etc.

---

## Exams

### Can you provide examples of acceptable calculators, and examples of unacceptable calculators

**Acceptable:**

- Casio FX-83GTX Scientific Calculator
- Casio FX-991EX Engineering/Scientific Calculator
- Sharp SH-ELW531TGWH Scientific Calculator
- Sharp EL531WH Scientific Calculator

**Unacceptable:**

- Casio Graphics Calculator FX-9750GII (because it can plot graphs)
- Casio CLASSPAD330-B-EH Graphical Calculator (because it can plot graphs and can do differentiation)
- Sharp EL 9450 Calculator (because it can plot graphs)
- Sharp SH-EL9950G BX EN Graphing Calculator (because it can plot graphs)

### Will you be expanding test centers The closest one to me is rather far away

- There are no plans to expand test centres at present. Please see [this link](https://london.ac.uk/current-students/examinations/examination-centres) for a list of over 500 approved exam centres.

### What referencing style should I use when submitting my work

- There is no specific style enforced, although consistency across your work is key to producing professional-looking results.
- Good starting points include the [Harvard](https://onlinelibrary.london.ac.uk/support/information-skills/organising-and-citing-your-references/referencing-styles-harvard) and [IEEE](https://ieee-dataport.org/sites/default/files/analysis/27/IEEE%20Citation%20Guidelines.pdf) referencing styles. Some students have also used footnotes in Google Docs.

### If we sit the exam outside the UK, in a local examination centre, then it is done via British council, isn't it

> I wonder whether you collaborate with local experts (IT professors) or there are only British Council representatives who collect the papers and send them for evaluation to London?

- You will sit your exams at one of over 500 approved centres around the world (including local Ministries of Education or the British Council). These centres are separate from local teaching institutions and they charge a fee for hosting the exam. These papers are then gathered and returned to London for marking. For further information about exams, please see [https://london.ac.uk/current-students/examinations](https://london.ac.uk/current-students/examinations).

### How many exams will be there per semester for a module

- Please be advised that this will depend on how many modules you register for and will be determined by the assessment requirements for those modules.

### Do online learners need to take assessments at specific locations? If so is this only final assessments

- The University has 400 approved examination centres worldwide, so you don't need to travel to London to sit your exams. These centres charge a fee for hosting the exam. The fees are set by the exam centre so may vary by country and venue.
- Therefore, I would recommend that you check the fees with the exam centre directly. Please see the following link which provides a full list of available examination centres and their contact details: [http://bit.ly/2At85Fu](http://bit.ly/2At85Fu).

### Can you please describe a written examination for Computational Math or Discrete Math? Is it usually a test or teachers check hand written answers

- Students are required to sit for a written examination at a local examination centre. It will then go through a rigorous marking process before students receive their marks.

### Have you considered using ProctorU as a distributed exam solution It seems to have a fair amount of adoption among MOOC providers

- There is a project at UoL which is looking into exam proctoring. I believe they are considering ProctorU.

---

## Grades and results

### How does the grading work and what's the assessment structure of this degree

- See [the Grades Guide in the Subreddit section of the REPL](../subreddit/grades-guide.md) for details.

### My peer-reviewed work isn't graded yet, what can I do

- Ask in the Slack channel :lock: [#reviewexchange](https://app.slack.com/client/TDT1N1BUG/CJXHM0RTQ) (students only).

### Do I have to complete all the formative as well as the summative assessments on Coursera

- No, but you will learn more if you work hard. See [this article in the Subreddit section of the REPL](../subreddit/formative-summative.md) for details.

### How do you assign grades? Grading on a Curve or absolute grading

- Information about the grading policy can be found within the BSc Computer Science Orientation Course. Please see [https://www.coursera.org/learn/london-cs-orientation/supplement/rZzTr/grading-policy](https://www.coursera.org/learn/london-cs-orientation/supplement/rZzTr/grading-policy).

### What are the deadlines to complete summative quizzes

- You can find **soft** deadlines in the **Grades** section of each module on Coursera. Those are _advised_ deadlines and give you a good idea of what progress you should have been making and how you should roughly be pacing yourself.
- You have until the submission deadline for the mid-term of each module to submit summative quizzes: this is the **hard** deadline in case you miss the **soft** ones. You will still be able to submit summative quizzes after the mid-term, but they won't count towards your final grade. Please take into consideration the timezone information on the submission page for the mid-term as any work — or summative quizzes due before the mid-term — will be awarded zero marks if you submit after the **hard** deadline, even if it's on the same day.

### Can we get a transcript of our studies

- Yes. Partial transcripts for the courses you've taken can be requested: please follow the instructions [on this page](https://london.ac.uk/ways-study/study-campus-london/student-services-and-support/requesting-a-transcript).

---

## General topics

### Do we get a dedicated student advisor, as it is customary in other countries (for example the US)

- As a student of the University of London you will have access to academic support and feedback from London-based support teams. Your online tutor will introduce the modules, respond to academic queries, and provide guidance on assessments through the Online Tutor Forum. Your Student Relationship Managers are available to assist you with non-academic and administrative queries via the Reach Out Forum in the Orientation Module, and via the support email <BscCs-support@london.ac.uk>.

### If we produce something during our studies, who "owns" it

> In one UoL's correspondence it said that we would need to reach out to our professor if we wanted to monetize it. How would we go about that for this degree being online?

The section of the University’s Intellectual Property Rights Policy that specifically addresses your question is Part E. Please see [https://london.ac.uk/sites/default/files/governance/intellectualpropertypolicy.pdf](https://london.ac.uk/sites/default/files/governance/intellectualpropertypolicy.pdf).

If you have any specific queries about something you have created which you are interested in publishing, please contact us via the support email <BscCs-support@london.ac.uk> and we can look into this further for you.

### Are there opportunities for students to gain some form of work experience in the industry or even undergo internships during the course

- I am afraid that this would not be provided by the University of London, however, we would not discourage students attempting to seek work experience on their own accord.

### I feel I need to vent, where can I go

- [https://my.london.ac.uk/group/student/talkcampus](https://my.london.ac.uk/group/student/talkcampus)
- Visit the :lock: [#vent](https://app.slack.com/client/TDT1N1BUG/CJG51H2CS) channel on Slack (students only).

## Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL)

### What professional certificates are suitable for RPL

You can find the up-to-date list of certificates eligible for automatic RPL [here](https://london.ac.uk/applications/how-apply/recognition-prior-learning/recognition-and-accreditation-prior-learning-3).

- [Google IT Support Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-it-support)
- [IBM AI Engineering Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ai-engineer)
- [IBM Applied AI Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/applied-artifical-intelligence-ibm-watson-ai)
- [IBM Data Science Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-science)

### How to apply for an automatic RPL

- See [this article](../subreddit/rpl-guide.md) in the Subreddit section of the REPL for an example on how to get RPL in How Computers Work module with Google IT Professional Certificate.
- Sample steps needed to register RPL credits:
  1. Open [online enquiry](https://sid.london.ac.uk/sid/login/newuserform.aspx) stating you want to apply for RPL and attaching Coursera certification.
  2. Wait for a reply. It can take a while, such as 2 weeks. Once it's confirmed, you'll receive an email saying the RPL application is approved.
  3. In the next registration, check if you see `Recognised Prior Learning` section in the bottom of `My Study` tab ([Sample screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/world-class/binary-assets/master/images/faq/recognised_prior_learning.png)). If you don't see this, you'll likely need to open an enquiry again to tell them the accepted RPL does not show up in registration.
  4. If it's successfully added, once you start adding modules, you'll see a prompt to use RPL credits ([Sample screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/world-class/binary-assets/master/images/faq/accreditation_prior_learning.png)).
  5. Confirm the use of RPL and proceed to registration as usual.

### Is RPL time limited

> For example, if I've taken an equivalent course at Uni 10 years back, is that still qualified?

- Please note that the general regulations state the following regarding RPL: Your prior learning may
  count towards a University of London qualification provided that:

  a) the academic/professional requirements for the previous study can be verified by us;

  b) the range, quality and currency of the previous study and/or of a previous qualification, and its coherence with the studies to be undertaken, is confirmed as appropriate;

  c) **your prior learning was completed within the past five years, unless Programme Regulations indicate otherwise**.

### What can be accepted as RPL

- If you are registered on a full BSc programme, you may apply for recognition of prior learning for up to 120 credits. We consider applications for recognition of prior learning (RPL) on the basis of studies successfully completed at an appropriate level. Further information regarding automatic and discretionary RPL for BSc Computer Science can be found on the website [here](https://london.ac.uk/applications/how-apply/recognition-prior-learning/recognition-and-accreditation-prior-learning-3).

### Can we still apply RPL for Google IT Support course anytime during this semester or next

- You can apply at any time before you take your first level 5 module. To study modules at level 5, you need to have attempted all modules at level 4 first or — in the case of a RPL for How Computers Work — have that module approved by the university _before_ you can register for new modules as it would not count as an attempt yet (since it is being attempted outside UoL and not yet validated). **Beware that the university may take some time to process your application for RPL**: a RPL yet to be approved will prevent you from registering modules at level 5 (this applies to any other modules at level 4, too). See the progression rules in the programme regulations for details.

### Does a possible RPL only get considered if it is from another university, or could the content (syllabus) of other certifications be looked at for possible matching/consideration

- For credit to be awarded for your prior learning, you must have completed a syllabus of similar level and depth as part of a previous qualification, normally within the previous five years.
- You need to apply for any prior learning to be recognized and accredited. You can do this on the relevant section of the online application form.
- If you have already submitted your application but now wish to request recognition of your prior learning, please contact us.

## Performance-based admission

### For performance-based admission, can I take more than two module this session

- If you are entering any of the programmes via the Performance Based Admissions route, you are permitted to register for two modules only; Introduction to Programming I and either Computational or Discrete Mathematics, depending on module availability.

---

## Technical questions

### Which are the programming languages we will come across through the degree

\* This is not a major focus in the course.

### Do we get a choice of back/front end frameworks to use during the web modules

- For **Web Development**, no.

## Graduation and beyond

### Is this programme accredited

- _Summary: Yes, the University of London and this degree in particular are accredited_. See [this article in the Subreddit section of the REPL](../subreddit/accreditation.md) for details.

### How is this degree going to tie in or transfer over to the new MSc Data Science from UoL and the soon to come MSc Machine Learning on Coursera

> The ability to be able pursue Grad School is huge for me. And you probably know for Graduate School, students are required to provide Letters of Reference for their Application. Will the Online Tutors be the ones providing the letter since there is no interaction with the faculty at Goldsmiths?

- In regards to references, our Transcripts Office would be able to provide you with a general reference. You can also apply for a Letter of Certification from our Transcripts Office. Our Transcripts Office can provide an official letter of certification, which will confirm an award. You can contact us via the support email <bsccs-support@london.ac.uk> if you wish to request such a letter.

### Is there no honours in the UK? Do we qualify for a masters straight after Bsc

- Yes, to be considered for the award of the BSc degree with honours you are required to have passed modules to the value of 360 credits. If you are interested in postgraduate study, you would need to contact the institution that you intend to study at, as entrance requirements vary from institution to institution.

### Will there be difference in the diploma if we finish the degree online and on campus

- Your degree will be of exactly the same standard as a University of London degree awarded to an on-campus student by a Member Institution.

### Do usually students come to London to get their diplomas once they have graduated from UoL or are they being posted to graduates

- When you graduate from the University of London, you receive two important documents: your Final Diploma; and, in most cases, a Diploma Supplement. Students will receive their diploma and transcript via post. When you complete your degree, you have the option of joining students from around the world at our graduation ceremony in London, which is held in March each year.
