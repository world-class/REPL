### Slack Onboarding

#### Slack Onboarding Workflow ('Slack Tutor')

A Slack workflow welcomes new students joining the workspace to guide them on their journey from the very beginning by pointing them to this repository and other useful resources. Right now, the custom message sent by the workflow is as follow:

```
Hey @new_user_name! Welcome aboard. A few key points you will want to know to get started:

- *Reply using threads* to keep things neat instead of posting to the channel. :thumbsup:
* Read the *Programme Regulations* and the *Guidelines for Examinations*: london.ac.uk/sites/default/files/regulations/progregs-computer-science-2019-2020.pdf and london.ac.uk/sites/default/files/examiners/guidelines-for-examinations-2018-19.pdf
- *Post in the relevant channels*: there is a channel for each module, starting with `#cm`. For example, discrete maths questions should go in #cm1020-discrete-math. Use #askpreviouscohorts or #october2019batch for cohort specific discussion instead of #general.
- *Make sure a channel doesn't already exist* before creating another one with the same purpose. You can collaborate in a *private group work* by creating a *private channel* instead of a public one.
- *Curated list of course related resources* here: github.com/world-class/REPL
* Remember to check the *pinned messages* in each channel: you'll find useful info!
- *Please do your own research* (Slack, search engine, etc.) before asking a question that has been answered many times. For a start, make sure you have read all the documents you will find on that page: github.com/world-class/REPL#documents-and-resources-provided-publicly-by-the-university-of-london
* Don't forget the *_Search_ feature* available on Slack (specific keywords, messages from a specific user with *from:@username*, in different channels, by files, within certain dates, etc.). → slack.com/help/articles/202528808-search-in-slack
* Get in touch with your tutors and SRMs (Student Relationship Managers)! → github.com/world-class/REPL#reaching-out-to-tutors-and-srms
* Be *nice*, be *respectful*. Don't make jokes or post memes that target a particular gender, religion, nationality or sexuality — we're a global and multicultural community. *Some students may be more sensitive* about certain topics and we certainly *don't want to discriminate* anybody and *don't want to make Slack a hostile environment* in any way.
- *Do not violate UoL guidelines* (don’t post *illegal* materials, solutions to *graded quizzes* or big *chunks of code* related to any graded assignment).
- *Refer to specific modules, videos and quizzes by their number* (week and item numbers as shown in Coursera), so that it is easy for future users to look for answers. You'll find a #bugs channel to help you uncover if a bug you have encountered has been documented before: please post to that channel *only once a bug has been identified* as such in another channel.
- *Thank people* when they help you! :slightly_smiling_face: Despite the distance, we're still humans (most of us, anyways).

We hope you'll have a great time here! *_Remember that succeeding as a CS student has a lot to do with being able to find answers on your own and sharing them to cement your learning_* :bulb:.

Be well and *welcome* :slightly_smiling_face:!
```
