# _Data Science_ specialism modules

## Data Science

This module will develop your data science skillset so that you'll
be able to write programs that can read, process and analyse textual
and numerical data. You will be able to generate plots and interactive
visualisations of data and understand how to apply statistical methods
to the interpretation of results. You'll be able to use data analysis
in the decision-making process. You'll also learn about application
domains for data science.

## Databases and Advanced Data Techniques

This module aims to show you how to work with data in your computer
programs. You will learn how to use SQL and NoSQL databases to store
tabular data and documents. You will learn about the ethics of gathering
and processing data and why it is important to consider issues around
data security. You will learn about open data resources, and how you can
access them from your computer programs. You will learn about audio and
video data, and the challenges of working with this kind of data.

## Machine Learning and Neural Networks

This module provides a broad view of machine learning and neural
networks. You'll learn how to solve common machine learning problems
such as regression, classification, clustering, matrix completion and
pattern recognition. You'll explore how neural networks can be trained
and optimised. You'll learn how to develop machine learning systems
rapidly, and you will learn how to verify and evaluate the results.

## Advanced Web Development

Advanced Web Development teaches you how to build dynamic, data-driven
websites using databases, front-end frameworks and server-side
programming. You'll develop the skills needed for full stack web
development work and develop a web developer skillset, enabling you
to build and deploy complete, data-driven websites. You'll consider
different technologies for clientside web development such as HTML,
CSS, JavaScript and templates. You'll explore methods for developing
server-side web applications, by building web-accessible wrappers
around databases, consider scalability issues and learn about web app
configuration and deployment.

## Natural Language Processing

Natural Language Processing (NLP) provides a grounding in both
rule-based and statistical approaches to NLP, combining theoretical
study with hands-on work employing widely used software packages. The
module focuses on text processing and you'll learn about how to work
with text-based natural language in your programs. You'll explore
grammars and how they can be used to analyse text. You'll learn how
to use statistical analysis to extract information from and classify
text. You'll use appropriate programming libraries to implement NLP
workflows.

- [Six easy ways to run your Jupyter Notebook in the cloud](https://www.dataschool.io/cloud-services-for-jupyter-notebook/)
- [Tutorial: Advanced Jupyter Notebooks](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/advanced-jupyter-notebooks-tutorial/)

## Pandas

- [Modern Pandas](https://tomaugspurger.github.io/modern-1-intro) - _"This series is about how to make effective use of pandas, a data analysis library for the Python programming language. It's targeted at an intermediate level: people who have some experience with pandas, but are looking to improve."_
- [Official website](https://pandas.pydata.org/) - _"pandas is an open source, BSD-licensed library providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools for the Python programming language."_

## Working with data (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, IPython, Scikit-Learn...)

- [Kaggle: Micro-Courses](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/overview) - _"Practical data skills you can apply immediately: that's what you'll learn in these free micro-courses. They're the fastest (and most fun) way to become a data scientist or improve your current skills."_
- [Python Data Science Handbook: full text in Jupyter Notebooks](https://github.com/jakevdp/PythonDataScienceHandbook) - _"This repository contains the entire Python Data Science Handbook, in the form of (free!) Jupyter notebooks."_
