# Final Project

In this module, you'll undertake a substantial independent project
that allows you to demonstrate a wide range of skills such as project
planning, management, research, software implementation and written
presentation. **If you are enrolled on a specialist pathway as part of
the BSc, you'll be expected to undertake a project in your specialist
area.** You will integrate your knowledge gained throughout the degree
and use skills acquired in other modules in the implementation of your
final project. The work will consist of a combination of research and
software development. You will be expected to use methodologies from
various components of computer science, including your specialist
pathway if appropriate.
