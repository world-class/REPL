## Intelligent Signal Processing (CM3065)

This module aims to provide you with a broad experience of digital signal processing techniques
and applications. You will study how audio and video signals can be captured and processed by a
computer program. You will learn about time domain and frequency domain representations and
processing. You will learn how you can extract information from audio signals. You will implement
movement and face detection systems that work with live camera input.

Topics covered:

- Capturing representing and processing audio signals
- LTI systems and impulse responses
- Frequency domain representations
- Extracting features from signals
- Speech recognition
- Capturing, representing and processing camera input
- Computer vision: movement detection
- Computer vision: face detection
- Compressing signals

**Assessment:** Coursework only (Type II)
