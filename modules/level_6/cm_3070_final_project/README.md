## Final Project (CM3070)

In this module, you will undertake a substantial independent project
that will allow you to demonstrate a wide range of skills such as
project planning, management, research, software implementation, and
written presentation. If you are enrolled on a specialist pathway,
either as part of the BSc or a graduate diploma, you will be expected
to undertake a project in your specialist area. You will integrate
the knowledge gained throughout the programme and use skills acquired
in other modules in the implementation of your final project which
will be in computer science or your specialist area. The work will

various components of computer science, including your specialist
pathway if appropriate.
