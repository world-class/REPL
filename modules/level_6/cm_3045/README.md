## 3D Graphics and Animation (CM3045)

This module will cover advanced methods used in current state-of-the-art graphics and animation
systems. It will include the mathematical foundations, computational techniques and their use in
creative practice. By taking this module, you will learn how to write programs that generate
animated 3D graphics. There are several distinct study areas: 3D modelling and animation, the
graphics pipeline, simulation of physics and shader programming. You will study a range of
examples, and through these learn how you can program computer graphics in contemporary
graphical software for different applications.

Topics covered:

- Overview of 3D Graphics and mathematics for graphics
- 3D Models and Transforms
- Physics simulation
- Keyframe Animation
- Character Animation
- Rendering and the Graphics Pipeline
- Lighting, Materials and Texturing
- Shader Programming
- Vertex Shaders
- Fragment Shaders

**Assessment:** One two hour unseen written examination and coursework (Type I)
