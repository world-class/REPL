## Modules in the specialism

### Databases and Advanced Data Techniques

This module aims to show you how to work with data in your computer
programs. You will learn how to use SQL and NoSQL databases to store
tabular data and documents. You will learn about the ethics of gathering
and processing data and why it is important to consider issues around
data security. You will learn about open data resources, and how you can
access them from your computer programs. You will learn about audio and
video data, and the challenges of working with this kind of data.

### Machine Learning and Neural Networks

This module provides a broad view of machine learning and neural
networks. You'll learn how to solve common machine learning problems
such as regression, classification, clustering, matrix completion and
pattern recognition. You'll explore how neural networks can be trained
and optimised. You'll learn how to develop machine learning systems
rapidly, and you will learn how to verify and evaluate the results.

### Artificial Intelligence

Focusing on Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques, you will learn the
historical development of AI including search, vision and planning. You
will become familiar with the foundations of agent-based approaches to
software design, decision making and problem solving including under
uncertainty. You will have an opportunity to apply AI techniques to
particular problems such as game playing and decision making.

### Intelligent Signal Processing

Studying Intelligent Signal Processing will provide a broad experience
of digital signal processing techniques and applications. You will
study how programs can capture and process audio and video signals.
You'll learn about time domain and frequency domain representations
and processing and how you can extract information from audio signals.
You'll implement movement and face detection systems that work with
live camera input.

### Natural Language Processing

Natural Language Processing (NLP) provides a grounding in both
rule-based and statistical approaches to NLP, combining theoretical
study with hands-on work employing widely used software packages. The
module focuses on text processing and you'll learn about how to work
with text-based natural language in your programs. You'll explore
grammars and how they can be used to analyse text. You'll learn how
to use statistical analysis to extract information from and classify
text. You'll use appropriate programming libraries to implement NLP
workflows.
