with technology'. You will focus on the concepts behind modern user
experience design and production. You will gain a solid grasp and
practical experience of the process which allows the creation of
interactive systems. This process involves specification, design,
prototyping and evaluation. You will examine several design approaches

efficiency and usability. You will examine issues of accessibility from
the perspective of different populations.
