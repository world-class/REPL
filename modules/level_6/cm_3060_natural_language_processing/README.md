## Natural Language Processing (CM3060)

This module will provide you with a grounding in both rule-based and
statistical approaches to NLP, and it combines theoretical study with
hands-on work employing widely used software packages. The module
focuses on text processing, and by taking this module, you will learn
about how you can work with text-based natural language in your
computer programs. You will learn about grammars and how they can be
used to analyse text. You will learn how statistical analysis can be
used to extract information from and classify text. You will work in
an appropriate programming environment for NLP, using libraries to
implement NLP workflows.
