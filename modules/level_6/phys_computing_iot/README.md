# _Physical Computing and the Internet of Things_ specialism modules

### Databases and Advanced Data Techniques

This module aims to show you how to work with data in your computer
programs. You will learn how to use SQL and NoSQL databases to store
tabular data and documents. You will learn about the ethics of gathering
and processing data and why it is important to consider issues around
data security. You will learn about open data resources, and how you can
access them from your computer programs. You will learn about audio and
video data, and the challenges of working with this kind of data.

### Advanced Web Development

Advanced Web Development teaches you how to build dynamic, data-driven
websites using databases, front-end frameworks and server-side
programming. You'll develop the skills needed for full stack web
development work and develop a web developer skillset, enabling you
to build and deploy complete, data-driven websites. You'll consider
different technologies for client-side web development such as HTML,
CSS, JavaScript and templates. You'll explore methods for developing
server-side web applications, by building web-accessible wrappers
around databases, consider scalability issues and learn about web app
configuration and deployment.

### Physical Computing and the Internet of Things

Studying this module will introduce the technology involved in the
development and programming of hardware devices that can sense and act
in the environment. It explains and demonstrates how the environment,
which is inherently continuous, can be monitored by analogue electrical
and mechanical sensors, then captured and analysed using a computer,
which is a discrete system. A focus of this module is the interface
between the digital and the analogue. You'll learn basic physics,
electronics, programming and software engineering. The module's
practical objective is the development of the skills needed for
designing and building interactive physical devices.

### Interaction Design

In this module, you'll examine the notion of â€˜interaction with
technology'. You will focus on the concepts behind modern UX design
and production and gain a solid grasp and practical experience of
the process which allows the creation of interactive systems. This
process involves specification, design, prototyping and evaluation.
You'll examine several design approaches and techniques and consider
how they enable usability engineering. You'll learn how to evaluate
interactive systems against criteria such as efficiency and usability.
You'll examine accessibility issues from the perspective of different
populations.

### Intelligent Signal Processing

Studying Intelligent Signal Processing will provide a broad experience
of digital signal processing techniques and applications. You will
study how programs can capture and process audio and video signals.
You'll learn about time domain and frequency domain representations
and processing and how you can extract information from audio signals.
You'll implement movement and face detection systems that work with
live camera input.
