# _Web and Mobile Development_ specialism modules

### Databases and Advanced Data Techniques

This module aims to show you how to work with data in your computer
programs. You will learn how to use SQL and NoSQL databases to store
tabular data and documents. You will learn about the ethics of gathering
and processing data and why it is important to consider issues around
data security. You will learn about open data resources, and how you can
access them from your computer programs. You will learn about audio and
video data, and the challenges of working with this kind of data.

### Advanced Web Development

Advanced Web Development teaches you how to build dynamic, data-driven
websites using databases, front-end frameworks and server-side
programming. You'll develop the skills needed for full stack web
development work and develop a web developer skillset, enabling you
to build and deploy complete, data-driven websites. You'll consider
different technologies for clientside web development such as HTML,
CSS, JavaScript and templates. You'll explore methods for developing
server-side web applications, by building web-accessible wrappers
around databases, consider scalability issues and learn about web app
configuration and deployment.

### 3D Graphics and Animation

This module covers advanced methods used in current state-of-the-art
graphics and animation systems. It includes mathematical foundations,
computational techniques and their use in creative practice. In this
module, you'll learn how to write programs that generate animated
3D graphics. There are several distinct study areas: 3D modelling and
animation, the graphics pipeline, simulation of physics and shader
programming. You'll study a range of examples and learn how to program
graphics in contemporary graphical software for different applications.

### Mobile Development

The Mobile Development module aims to give you the fundamental
understanding and skills needed to develop mobile applications. By
studying this module, you will learn the principles of effective mobile
user interface design and how to design and build user interfaces.
You'll learn about datadriven mobile apps, and how you can integrate
an app with a data source. You'll learn about the mobile development
ecosystem and how to develop, run and test your applications. You'll
work with various sensors available on mobile devices using built-in
application programming interfaces. The style of the module is
practical, focusing on developing working apps.

### Interaction Design

In this module, you'll examine the notion of â€˜interaction with
technology'. You will focus on the concepts behind modern UX design
and production and gain a solid grasp and practical experience of
the process which allows the creation of interactive systems. This
process involves specification, design, prototyping and evaluation.
You'll examine several design approaches and techniques and consider
how they enable usability engineering. You'll learn how to evaluate
interactive systems against criteria such as efficiency and usability.
You'll examine accessibility issues from the perspective of different
populations.
