## Interaction Design [CM3055]

When taking this module, you will examine the notion of 'interaction
with technology'. You will focus on the concepts behind modern user
experience design and production. You will gain a solid grasp and
practical experience of the process which allows the creation of
interactive systems. This process involves specification, design,
prototyping and evaluation. You will examine several design approaches
and techniques, and consider how they enable usability engineering. You
will learn how to evaluate interactive systems against criteria such as
efficiency and usability. You will examine issues of accessibility from
the perspective of different populations.
