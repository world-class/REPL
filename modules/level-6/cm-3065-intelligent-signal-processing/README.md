# Intelligent Signal Processing (CM3065)

This module aims to provide you with a broad experience of digital
signal processing techniques and applications. You will study how audio
and video signals can be captured and processed by a computer program.
You will learn about time domain and frequency domain representations
and processing. You will learn how you can extract information from
audio signals. You will implement movement and face detection systems
that work with live camera input.

## Topics covered

- Capturing representing and processing audio signals
- LTI systems and impulse responses
- Frequency domain representations
- Extracting features from signals
- Speech recognition
- Capturing, representing and processing camera input
- Computer vision: movement detection
- Computer vision: face detection
- Compressing signals
