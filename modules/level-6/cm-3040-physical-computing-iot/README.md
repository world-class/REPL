## Physical Computing and the Internet of Things (CM3040)

This course provides an introduction to the development and programming
of hardware devices that can sense and act in the environment. The
course will explain and demonstrate how the environment, which is
inherently continuous, can be monitored by analogue electrical and
mechanical sensors, then captured and analysed using a computer, which
is a discrete system. A focus of this course is the interface between
the digital and the analogue.

This study encompasses basic physics, electronics, programming and
software engineering. The practical objective of this course is the
development of the skills needed for designing and building interactive
physical devices.
