# Games Development (CM3030)

This module will introduce you to i) industry standard tools for
game development, such as game engines, and ii) the process of game
development, including prototyping and playtesting. You will undertake
a short series of game development projects, each lasting a set number
of weeks and with a specific brief. For each project, you will propose
a game that fits the brief, and then you will implement it. You are
expected to deliver the proposed game and document it thoroughly.
Through this process, you will develop an awareness of intended audience
and the use of media for documentation.

Contemporary video game production draws on a range of techniques from
artificial intelligence (AI) to perform tasks such as controlling
virtual agents and generating novel game content. This module will also
introduce crucial game AI concepts. Compared to mainstream AI, the
emphasis is less on optimal problem solving and more on entertaining the
player with limited computational resources. This module gives students
practical experience of programming game AI systems and an understanding
of the relevant theory.
