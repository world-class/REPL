## Data Science (CM3005)

By taking this module, you will gain a data science skillset. With
these skills, you will be able to write computer programs that can
read, process and analyse textual and numerical data. You will be able
to generate plots and interactive visualisations of data. You will
understand how to apply statistical methods to the interpretation of
results. You will be able to use data analysis in the decision-making
process. You will also learn about a range of application domains for
data science.
