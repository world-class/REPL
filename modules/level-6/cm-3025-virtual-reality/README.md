## Virtual Reality (CM3025)

The module will combine the theory and psychology of VR with practical
development skills. You will learn the skills needed to design
compelling VR environments and the skills that apply to creative
practice, science and industry.

This module aims to give you the skills needed to develop VR. These
skills include understanding the basic theory of presence in VR,
which underlies the basic design principles. You will also learn
practical development skills, using an appropriate 3D engine to create
interactive virtual environments. These skills will include creating
3D environments, designing and implementing 3D interaction for VR and
building social VR experiences with interactive virtual characters.
