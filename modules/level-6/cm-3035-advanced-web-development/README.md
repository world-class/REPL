## Advanced Web Development (CM3035)

Through this module, you will learn how to build dynamic, data-driven
websites using databases, front-end frameworks and server-side
programming. This module provides the skill set required to do full
stack web development work. By studying this module, you will develop
a web developer skill set that enables you to understand how to build
and deploy complete, data-driven websites. You will consider several
different technologies for client side-web development such as HTML,
CSS, JavaScript and templates. You will explore methods for developing
server-side web applications, by building web-accessible wrappers around
databases. You will consider issues of scalability, and learn about web
application configuration and deployment.
