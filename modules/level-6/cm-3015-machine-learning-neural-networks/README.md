## Machine Learning and Neural Networks (CM3015)

This module provides a broad view of machine learning and neural
networks. You will learn how to solve common machine learning problems
such as regression, classification, clustering, matrix completion and
pattern recognition. You will learn about neural networks and how they
can be trained and optimised, including an exploration of deep neural
networks. You will learn about machine learning and neural network
software libraries that allow you to develop machine learning systems
rapidly, and you will learn how to verify and evaluate the results.

### Professor(s)
