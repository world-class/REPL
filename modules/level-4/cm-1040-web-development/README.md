## Web Development

This module provides you with a foundational web development skillset.
You will learn the critical languages of the web: HTML, CSS and
JavaScript. Using HTML and CSS, you'll learn how to markup, layout and
style web content. You'll study the document object model and how you
can dynamically manipulate it with JavaScript to create interactive web
pages. You'll consider accessibility and usability issues, and how you
can overcome them. You'll learn about website deployment and how to
make your websites accessible to other people. The module also enables
you to present your work online in the form of a website.

### Text editor

If you followed our guide at the [ITP1 resource page]('../cm-1005-introduction-to-programming-i/README.md'), then you already have Visual Studio Code set up. For this course, you may want to install the following extensions in addition to those recommended earlier:

- [IntelliSense for CSS class names in HTML](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Zignd.html-css-class-completion)
- [stylelint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=stylelint.vscode-stylelint) - checks for "code lint" in CSS. Requires [stylelint](https://stylelint.io/) to be installed, as well as a configuration of your choosing (for more information on installing and configuring stylelint, see the [stylelint Docs](https://stylelint.io/user-guide/get-started))
- [Web Accessibility](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MaxvanderSchee.web-accessibility) - recommends ways for improving the accessibility of web pages. This isn't an "accessibility silver bullet", but it's a start
