# Programming with Data

This module will show you how to work with data: getting data from a
variety of sources, visualising data in compelling, informative ways,
processing data to make it useful and shareable, and reasoning with
data to test hypotheses and make parameterised predictions. The module
will also introduce you to a new language and programming environment
that is well-adapted to languages for these applications.
