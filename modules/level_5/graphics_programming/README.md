# Graphics Programming

This module aims to show you how to work with images in a variety of
ways. You will learn how to synthesise graphics and how to process
visual signals. You will learn about the mathematical ideas that
underpin digital representations of graphics; how digital media files
represent graphics, and how to handle and manipulate them; and the
basics of working with simulated physics and 3D graphics.
