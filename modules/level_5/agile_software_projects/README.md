# Agile Software Projects

This module aims to provide insights and practice in software
development using contemporary methods to produce software that meets
the needs of users and supports an organisationâ€™s business function.
The module will enable you to gain competence in the conceptualisation
of a technology-based solution to a real-world problem, fulfilling
the requirements of users and taking constraints imposed by the
prevailing and foreseen market conditions and lessons learned from
prototypes into account. You will then be given the opportunity to
present a proposal for a technical project including a structured plan
for implementing the solution using the agile development methodology
and test driven development practices. During the whole process from
concept to solution presentation, you will be required to work in a
distributed team using online collaboration, project tracking and
version control tools.
