# Algorithms and Data Structures II

This module aims to provide you with detailed knowledge of several
common algorithms and data structures. You will improve your
understanding of searching and sorting and learn new algorithms to
solve new problems. You will learn about a range of data structures
such as trees, heaps, sets, maps, stacks, queues and graphs. You will
learn how to evaluate and describe the performance of algorithms
using big-O notation. You will learn: how to choose appropriate data
structures for representing problems, how to define and implement
algorithms for manipulating them, and how to analyse the correctness
and efficiency of algorithms.

You will be expected to have mastered the material in Algorithms and
Data Structures I before attempting this module.

# Topics covered

- Complexity, growth of functions and big-O notation
- Stacks and queues
- Binary trees
- Heaps and priority queues
- Implicit array algorithms
- Recursion and Iteration
- Graphs and simple pathfinding
- Shortest-path algorithms
- Sets, maps and hash tables
- Collections

# Assessment

One two hour unseen written examination and coursework (Type I)
