# Fundamentals of Computer Science

In this module, you'll gain a broad understanding of key topic areas in
computer science and the fundamental concepts underpinning them. In the
area of fundamental concepts, you'll learn about binary representations
and logic, complexity theory and theories of computation, finite state
machines and Turing machines. Building on this, you'll then study key
areas of interest in computer science including databases, artificial
intelligence and machine learning. These will be presented as practical
examples to illustrate how they are implemented in modern computer
systems.

# Topics covered

- Boolean logic
- Algorithms
- Searching and sorting algorithms
- Theory of Computation and complexity
- Turing machines and universal machines
- Basic combinatorial principles
- Proof techniques
- Finite automata
- Regular languages
- Context-free grammar

# Assessment

One two hour unseen written examination and coursework (Type I)
