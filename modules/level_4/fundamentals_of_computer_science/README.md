# Fundamentals of Computer Science
In this module, you'll gain a broad understanding of key topic
areas in computer science and the fundamental concepts underpinning
them. In the area of fundamental concepts, you'll learn about
binary representations and logic, complexity theory and theories of
computation, finite state machines and Turing machines. Building on
this, you'll then study key areas of interest in computer science
including databases, artificial intelligence and machine learning. These
will be presented as practical examples to illustrate how they are
implemented in modern computer systems.
