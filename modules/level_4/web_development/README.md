# Web Development

This module provides you with a foundational web development skillset.
You will learn the critical languages of the web: HTML, CSS and
JavaScript. Using HTML and CSS, you'll learn how to markup, layout and
style web content. You'll study the document object model and how you
can dynamically manipulate it with JavaScript to create interactive web
pages. You'll consider accessibility and usability issues, and how you
can overcome them. You'll learn about website deployment and how to
make your websites accessible to other people. The module also enables
you to present your work online in the form of a website.
