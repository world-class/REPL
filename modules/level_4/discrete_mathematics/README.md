# Discrete Mathematics

This module helps hone your skills in thinking abstractly. It also
introduces you to many of the discrete models used to help understand
and design computational systems. Through this module, you'll develop
the fundamental discrete mathematical tools that will support you during
the BSc degree. Particular attention is paid to notions of
experimentation, reasoning and generalisation.
