# How Computers Work

How Computers Work helps you understand and interact with computer
systems. The module will teach you how to use knowledge about
computational processes to analyse and explain the behaviour of computer
systems. It will use the concept of a Notional Machine, an abstract
representation of the functioning of a computer system, to help you to
reason about computer systems and predict their behaviour. You'll also
learn about typical computer system architectures, basic networking and
network services such as databases.
