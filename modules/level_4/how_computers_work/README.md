# How Computers Work

How Computers Work helps you understand and interact with computer
systems. The module will teach you how to use knowledge about
computational processes to analyse and explain the behaviour of computer
systems. It will use the concept of a Notional Machine, an abstract
representation of the functioning of a computer system, to help you to
reason about computer systems and predict their behaviour. You'll also
learn about typical computer system architectures, basic networking and
network services such as databases.

# Topics covered

- Introduction to Computer Science and Notional Machines
- Notional machines of web applications
- Data representations, data storage, compression
- Computer Architecture and Machine Language
- Operating Systems
- Operating System processes
- Networks
- The internet
- Data and Databases
- Machine Learning

# Assessment

One two hour unseen written examination and coursework (Type I)

# Resources

## Essential reading

_"The essentials readings for this course will come from the following text book, which you will be able access from within some lessons on Coursera platform:_

_**Brookshear, J.G. and D. Brylow Computer science: an overview. (Harlow: Pearson Education, 2015) 12th edition (Global edition).**_

_This course does not require you to read the whole book; you will be given specific readings for each topic from these texts are listed with direct links on the Readings page for each topic._

_You will also be asked to do some independent research from online sources or using the University of London digital library."_
