## Computer Security

This module aims to provide you with an understanding of the need for
computer security and the technologies that support it. It has both a
theoretical component that will teach you mathematical underpinnings
of security systems and a practical element that will help you
discover the pitfalls of security design and to comprehend the
mathematics underlying the protocols by programming small examples.

# Topics covered

- Security threats
- Social Issues in Computer Security
- Access Control and Authentication
- Security Models
- Operating System Security
- Network security
- Cryptography
- Cryptographic protocols and key management
- Public Key Cryptography
- Blockchain protocols
