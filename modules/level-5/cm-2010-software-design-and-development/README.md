# Software Design and Development

This module aims to advance your software development skills so that
you can write more robust and complicated programs. You will learn
how to use a range of programming techniques that will allow you to
deal with unwanted or unexpected events that might happen when your
application is running. You will use defensive coding to check data
before processing it, and exception handling to gracefully manage
unforeseen or unwanted occurrences. You will learn how to discuss
program structure concerning cohesion (how to meaningfully organise
code into modules) and coupling (how to define the interactions
between different parts of the program). You will learn about
test-driven development, where you write tests for your code, and
write the code itself, in parallel. You will also learn how to use
software versioning tools to manage a software project as it develops.
