# Graphics Programming

This module aims to show you how to work with images in a variety of
ways. You will learn how to synthesise graphics and how to process
visual signals. You will learn about the mathematical ideas that
underpin digital representations of graphics; how digital media files
represent graphics, and how to handle and manipulate them; and the
basics of working with simulated physics and 3D graphics.

## Professor(s)

### Primary programming language

JavaScript

## Resources

### Complementary learning

- [Collision Detection](https://github.com/jeffThompson/CollisionDetection) - Uses [Processing](https://github.com/processing-js/processing-js) (deprecated), which is similar to but not the same as [p5js](https://p5js.org). _"This book explains the algorithms behind [...] collisions using basic shapes like circles, rectangles, and lines so you can implement them into your own projects."_.
- [Image Processing in p5.js](https://idmnyu.github.io/p5.js-image/) - _"Basic setup, filters, layers, animation setup, blur, edge detection."_
